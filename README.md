Myntra Clone is a front-end e-commerce website inspired by Myntra, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project recreates the look and feel of a real online fashion store and helps strengthen front-end development skills through practical UI implementation.

The clone includes a responsive homepage with hero banners, categories, and product listings. It has a fully designed navigation bar with logo, search bar, profile, wishlist, and cart icons to resemble a real shopping website. Product cards display images, names, prices, and discounts with hover effects to enhance user experience.

The footer section contains important links, contact info, and social media icons. The entire layout is responsive using Flexbox and CSS Grid, ensuring it looks good on desktops, tablets, and mobiles. Basic interactivity like hover states, dropdown menus, and simple cart design (if added) are handled using plain JavaScript.

This project aims to help beginners practice website layout structuring, clean styling, and adding interactivity without using any frameworks. It also teaches how to organize files and write maintainable front-end code.
